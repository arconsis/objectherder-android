# objectherder-android (deprecated)

## At a glance ##
objectherder-android is a lightweight framework, to create or reuse objects in the time an user expects an AppCompatActivity or a Fragment to be the same.

Objects are kept when:

 - Orientation is changed
 - the app goes to background and is resumed
 - another Activity ist started

Objects are removed when:

 - an Activity is closed with back
 - a Fragment is removed

#Deprecated so soon

You better use official API from google 
[android architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html) which was announced some month after the initial version of objectherder-android
